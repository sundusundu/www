The loud style of this early work by Hals suits its subject, which is Vastenavond (Shrovetide or Mardi Gras), a pre-Lenten carnival featuring bad food and worse behavior. Two characters from the comic stage, Peeckelhaering (Pickled Herring) and Hans Wurst (John Wiener?), cozy up to a young "lady" with a Dutch boy haircut and a bull neck. Hans's gesture, the deflated bagpipe, and other motifs comprise a chorus of sexual commentary. The picture looks surprisingly Flemish in its vivid coloring, loose brushwork, and crowded composition, which suggests that it may date from slightly after Hals's three months in Antwerp during 1616. In that mecca for Netherlandish artists he could have seen great works by Rubens and the early paintings of his own Flemish counterpart, Jacob Jordaens (1593–1678).</br>

<a id="heilbrunnLink1" href="#"><strong>Food and Drink in European Painting, 1400&ndash;1800</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn1">

<P><P>From an apple held by the infant Jesus</a> to a fowl indelicately handled by a lusty kitchen maid, food and drink appear in myriad contexts over four centuries of European painting. The practice of depicting food and feasting stretches back through the Middle Ages to ancient Greece</a> and Rome, where banquets and bacchanals were consuming passions celebrated in literature, painting</a>, and mosaics (as in the trompe l'oeil "unswept floor" mosaic from the emperor Hadrian's villa</a> at Tivoli, littered with fish bones, fruit pits, nutshells, and other dining table scraps). In the fifteenth century, artists took increasing inspiration from the culture of antiquity and from the natural world, and began to depict objects such as fruits, sweets, and wine vessels, as well as flora and fauna, in both devotional and secular images. These items allowed the artist to display virtuosic skills of observation and description of color, shape, and texture. They also often carried a symbolic meaning or an allusion to the painting's subject.</P></P>
</br>


		<p><P>The symbolism of food and drink has roots in classical literature. Fruits, nuts, herbs, and grain are discussed in treatises on farming and natural history, and appear widely in mythology as attributes of gods and goddesses</a>&#151;grapes for Bacchus, god of wine</a>; a sheaf of corn or wheat for Ceres, the grain goddess&#151;and in metaphors for virtue and vice. Early religious writings such as the Bible and the Apocrypha, and Christian texts of the Middle Ages</a> and Renaissance</a> are also rich in this imagery, often borrowing from pagan symbolism and occasionally supplanting it. The pomegranate, for example, is depicted in mythological paintings as an attribute of Venus and a symbol of desire, fertility</a>&#151;because of its many seeds&#151;and marriage</a>, but appears as frequently in sacred images of the Virgin</a> and Child. There are several legends of the pomegranate's creation, contributing to its symbolic potency; according to one, it grew out of blood streaming from the wounded genitals</a> of the lustful Acdestis. The pomegranate is perhaps best known, however, for its fateful role in the myth of Proserpina. Ovid tells in the <I>Metamorphoses</I> of Proserpina's abduction by Pluto, ruler of the Underworld. Proserpina's mother, Ceres, secured her release from Hades, but, before leaving Proserpina, ate the seeds from a pomegranate and, because she had consumed food in the Underworld, was compelled to spend part of every year there. Proserpina's cyclical descent to Hades and rise to Earth was believed to bring about the changing of seasons, and the pomegranate was thus seen as a symbol of resurrection and immortality.<br /><br />In Christian imagery, the pomegranate serves much the same purpose, as in three examples from the Museum's collection: one of about 1485 by the Florentine painter Filippino Lippi</a> (49.7.10</a>), and two by the Netherlandish</a> Joos van Cleve (32.100.57</a>; 1982.60.47</a>) from the first quarter of the sixteenth century. In the Joos panels, the Virgin is depicted as a noblewoman, elegantly attired and seated before a ledge ranged with a bowl of fruit, a nut, and a filled wineglass. The latter, as well as the bunch of grapes in 1982.60.47</a>, allude to the Last Supper, when Jesus gave wine to his disciples and said, "This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you" (Luke 22:20). A halved nut, according to the twelfth-century Abbot Adam of Perseigne, symbolized the Holy Trinity, because it had three parts: an outer marrow, a shell, and an inner kernel. In the Old Testament, it was written that Aaron's rod blossomed and bore nuts, foreshadowing Christ's Incarnation. Beyond their allusive nature, the nut and other components of the still life serve a decorative purpose as well, and were delicacies not uncommon to a gentlewoman's table.<br /><br />Many other fruits appear in Western painting, all having some possible symbolism. The most recognizable, and perhaps the most widely used, is the apple. Because the Latin word for "apple" and "evil" are the same&#151;<I>malum</I>&#151;the apple was associated with the Tree of Knowledge from which Eve ate forbidden fruit, causing the downfall of Man. The infant Jesus is frequently depicted with an apple (32.100.57</a>; 1982.60.47</a>) to signify his role as Redeemer from sin and death. In a <I>Madonna and Child</I> by Carlo Crivelli (49.7.5</a>), a festoon of apples and a cucumber-like gourd represent the triumph of Salvation over Damnation: the gourd was associated with the former because in the biblical story of Jonah, God caused a gourd to grow over the prophet's head as a shelter. The apple is not the only fruit proffered by the figure of Christ in painting</a>: often he holds a pomegranate, cherries&#151;which could allude both to the child's sweetness and to the sacrifice of his blood&#151;or a quince (08.183.1</a>). The quince was sacred to the ancients as an attribute of Venus and an emblem of marriage and fertility, and according to Pliny a cutting from the quince tree would form another tree when planted. It was thus associated with immortality.<br /><br />By the seventeenth century, still-life painting flourished as an independent genre, particularly in the Netherlands</a>, Italy, and Spain</a>. Lombard</a> painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio</a> (1571&#150;1610) did much to advance this genre by including still-life elements&#151;considered shockingly naturalistic by some contemporary viewers&#151;into religious and allegorical works. In <I>The Musicians</I> (52.81</a>), Cupid is shown at left with a bunch of grapes, "because music</a> was invented to keep spirits happy, as does wine" (Ripa). Foodstuffs and serving vessels depicted with exquisite realism and detail enjoyed enormous popularity among an affluent clientele who could appreciate not only the skillful rendering of such subjects but also the significance of the objects depicted. Expensive delicacies such as shellfish (1971.254</a>) and lemons (53.111</a>), and hunting trophies of game and fowl (50.55</a>) were associated with a privileged lifestyle which the owner was either accustomed to or, more likely, wished to be identified with. In many still-life paintings, comestible items serve no obvious allegorical purpose, or may be viewed as general reminders of the transient nature of luxury, the virtue of temperance, or the perils of gluttony.<br /><br />In genre scenes</a>, however, artists of the period frequently used "meaningful" food imagery to exuberant&#151;and often outrageous&#151;effect. Frans Hals</a>'s painting of revelers at Vastenavond (known elsewhere as Mardi Gras) includes two stock figures from popular comedy: Pekelharing, or Pickled Herring, and Hans Worst, or John Sausage (14.40.605</a>). Pekelharing wears a garland of Shrovetide victuals, including salted herring and mussels, which symbolized the male and female genitals, respectively. Eggs, also present in the garland, were considered an aphrodisiac and symbolized male prowess or, when cracked (as here), impotence. The figure wears a pig's trotter, symbol of gluttony, at his waist. Sausages dangle from Hans Worst's cap and are also on the table, which is strewn with an array of items alluding to "male" and "female" forms. The abundance of phallic imagery coupled with the obscene gestures of the figures made this image too lewd for the average household. It may have been painted for the private enjoyment of an enthusiast of bawdy comedy</a> or for a chamber of <I>rederijkers</I>, or rhetoricians, who put on farcical plays. More likely to be found in a domestic setting</a>, but no less laden with carnal imagery, is Peter Wtewael's scene of a young man flirting with a comely kitchen maid (06.288</a>). The theme descended from Pieter Aertsen (1507/8&#150;1575) and in early examples conveyed religious and ethical ideas while entertaining the viewer with scenes from everyday life. Dutch authors such as Erasmus (1466?&#150;1536) and Dirck Volkertsz Coornhert (1522&#150;1590) condemned, in the latter's words, "the most contemptible occupations which serve the appetites, such as fishmongers, butchers, cooks, pastrycooks, perfume-sellers, dancers</a>, and all manner of gamesters." Contemporary viewers would have been familiar with this kind of admonition; nevertheless, the mood in Wtewael's kitchen is lighthearted. Jan Steen provides a view of the chaos that overruns a household when appetites go unchecked (1982.60.31</a>). Here, an elegant arrangement of fruit stands in for gluttony and the potentially corruptive nature of luxury</a> among a veritable catalogue of vices represented by various objects. In the same canvas, an ample joint of meat sits on the floor for the cat to snatch away. The mistress of the house is clearly too focused on the refilling of her wineglass to notice this or the amorous entanglement of her husband and the serving maid.<br /><br />The symbolic potency of this kind of imagery lived on into the eighteenth century, even as the popularity of genre painting waned in the Netherlands. French painter Jean Baptiste Greuze (1725&#150;1805) modeled his canvas of 1756 (20.155.8</a>) on a work by Frans van Mieris the Elder (1635&#150;1681). In it, the young woman's woeful expression may be attributed to the basket of broken eggs beside her, and not merely because it represents the loss of her next meal. The presence of a dismayed young man and an accusing old woman indicates that lost virtue is really the matter at hand. Meanwhile, a little boy attempts to repair one of the broken eggs, reminding the viewer of the uncorrupted innocence of childhood.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink2" href="#"><strong>Frans Hals (1582/83&ndash;1666)</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn2">

<P><P>The celebrated portraitist and genre painter</a> Frans Hals has been placed second only to Rembrandt van Rijn</a> and, during the past hundred years, to Vermeer</a> in the pantheon of great Dutch painters of the "Golden Age." In the second half of the nineteenth century, Hals was actually the most admired artist in some quarters&mdash;especially in Paris, since Vermeer's small oeuvre was still only beginning to be defined, and Hals' bourgeois subjects, his often colorful palette, and above all his bold brushwork became more inspiring to Realist</a> and Impressionist</a> painters than was the venerable model of Rembrandt.</P></P>
</br>


		<p><P>Like many less famous Dutch artists, Hals was actually from the Spanish Netherlands; his parents moved from Antwerp to Haarlem when he was quite young (probably about 1586, and certainly before his brother, the genre painter Dirck Hals [1591&ndash;1656], was born). Frans reportedly studied with the Mannerist</a> painter and writer on art Karel van Mander (1584&ndash;1606), probably about 1600&ndash;1603. He joined the Haarlem painters' guild in 1610 and married about the same time. The earliest known works by Hals are impressive formal portraits of ca. 1612&ndash;14, when he was already about thirty years old. From 1612 to 1624, Hals served in the Saint George civic guard in Haarlem; his portrait of that company's officers, of 1616 (Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem), was the first of about ten large group portraits that Hals painted for public institutions. The last two, depicting the male and female regents of the old men's almshouse in Haarlem (Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem), date from about 1664, when the artist was about eighty-two years old. From the 1860s onward, these works and others by Hals in his hometown museum made Haarlem a mecca for painters such as Courbet</a>, Manet</a>, Monet</a>, Van Gogh</a>, Sargent</a>, Whistler</a>, Chase</a>, and other masters of the brush, especially from France and America. As in the case of Vermeer, the French art and social critic Th&eacute;ophile Thor&eacute; (1807&ndash;1869) was an early champion of Hals.</P><br /><P>Haarlem had been a fairly cosmopolitan artistic center since the 1580s, with internationally known artists such as Van Mander, Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem (1562&ndash;1638), and above all the great draftsman and engraver (and, from 1600, painter) Hendrick Goltzius</a> (1558&ndash;1617). Nonetheless, Hals' <em>Merrymakers at Shrovetide</em>, of about 1616 (14.40.605</a>), is more colorful, painterly, and swirling with surface movement than almost any Dutch painting to date. Its shift in style from slightly earlier works by Hals probably reflects his study trip to Antwerp from about early August until mid-November in 1616. The way the crowded figures and objects on the table completely fill the frame and appear pressed against the picture plane, and are painted in broad, open brushstrokes, with bold colors and shadows rendered in tones of blue and green, recalls works by Rubens</a> of about 1610&ndash;15 and early pictures by his young colleague Jacob Jordaens (1593&ndash;1678), including the <I>Adoration of the Shepherds</I>, of 1616 (66.53.7). In Antwerp, Hals may also have seen oil sketches and impetuously executed history pictures by the teenaged prodigy Anthony van Dyck</a> (1599&ndash;1641).</P><br /><P>By November 1616, Hals' wife and two of their three small children had died. In February 1617, the painter married a Haarlem woman, who gave birth to a daughter nine days later. Ten other children from this marriage are known. For the next half-century, Hals rarely left Haarlem, where he was a respected and successful but never prosperous citizen. His clients included a good number of burgomasters and wealthy citizens, including leading figures in the local beer and cloth industries. At various times, and especially in his late years, Hals struggled financially, mainly because of the large size of his family and the fact that few Dutch portraitists</a> were well paid.</P><br /><P>The notion that Hals' difficulties had more to do with drinking and lack of discipline was first introduced by the inventive biographer Arnold Houbraken in 1718 and flourished in the late nineteenth century. This image of Hals (like Houbraken's biography of Jan Steen) was simply derived from his genre paintings and is unsupported&mdash;indeed, contradicted&mdash;by documentary evidence. Hals' popular scenes of "everyday life" (which date mainly from the 1620s and 1630s) are in fact highly conventionalized essays on contemporary social customs and the human comedy in general. As a brilliant portraitist, the artist was quite capable of lending his genre figures strongly individualized characters and convincing expressions, as he did in his seductive picture of a country courtesan, <I>The Gipsy Girl</I> (Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris). His pictures of mirthful children and of diverse fisher folk were evidently based on life studies as well (unfortunately, no drawings by Hals are known). However, the majority of Hals' genre pictures, like the <I>Young Man and Woman in an Inn ("Yonker Ramp and His Sweetheart")</I>, of 1623 (14.40.602</a>), employ standard types in clever variations. This becomes obvious when one compares the figures (especially the young "ladies") in the canvas of 1623 and a panel of about 1625, The Smoker (89.15.34</a>). Both paintings address the theme of the "Modern-Day Prodigal Son" (the title of a Dutch play published in 1630), while the earlier one recalls a contemporary adage: "the nuzzle of dogs, the affection of whores, and the hospitality of innkeepers: None of it comes without cost." The theme of frivolous youth was topical in the Dutch Republic, at a time when the older generation complained (like postwar parents in America</a>) that their spoiled kids knew nothing of hardship and earning one's keep.</P><br /><P>Despite the great reputation of Hals' best known genre scenes and group portraits, the essence of his achievement is found in portraits of individuals, as in the <I>Portrait of a Man, possibly Nicolaes Pietersz Duyst van Voorhout</I>, of about 1636&ndash;38 (49.7.33</a>). The confident pose repeats that found in Hals' famous picture <I>The Laughing Cavalier</I></a>, of 1624 (Wallace Collection, London), which is actually a formal portrait in which the dignified gentleman faintly smiles. In the later portrait, broadly brushed highlights suggest the shine of the satin jacket and the naturalistic effects of daylight, atmosphere, and movement all at once. In addition, almost every stroke in the figure (but especially in the face) contributes to the impression of modeling and space, a fact that Hals' contemporary imitators, later emulators, and many critics have misunderstood. The idea that Hals executed his pictures rapidly, advanced already by Houbraken in 1718, is nonsensical to conservators and close viewers of his technique. What a few contemporaneous observers described as the impression of "life itself" in Hals' work was arrived at with virtuoso flair but also careful control, and with an eye to the impression made by the work at a normal viewing distance and in the light of a seventeenth-century interior. Comparisons with the flattening effects of Manet</a> reveals at once great admiration of Hals (and Vel&aacute;zquez</a>) and a different concept of representation.</P><br /><P>What is more comparable with the achievement of later portraitists is Hals' ability in his single portraits to suggest distinctive personalities. Whether in the dashing portraits of the 1630s or the more sober examples of the next three decades (as in the <I>Paulus Verschuur</I>, of 1643; 26.101.11</a>), Hals conveys individuality more convincingly than almost any artist of the time, except Rembrandt. More than a century later (in 1774), Sir Joshua Reynolds</a>, who esteemed Rubens, Van Dyck, and Rembrandt, told students of the Royal Academy in London that Hals' "composition of the face"&mdash;no doubt meaning mainly the handling of the eyes and mouth&mdash;produced "that strong-marked character of individual nature, which is so remarkable in his portraits, and is not found in an equal degree in any other painter." Of course, this ability is not equally evident in every work. Many of Hals' portraits suggest friendliness, preoccupation, or reserve, without giving away much about the person. The emphasis placed in modern times on personal thoughts and feelings was barely beginning in the seventeenth century, with exceptional authors such as Shakespeare and John Donne. Hals' wonderful portraits of married couples and families (like the large group portrait in the Museo Thyssen-Bornesmisza, Madrid) convey a strong sense of individuality but are essentially about the institution of marriage. Similarly, many of Hals' sitters wanted to be portrayed as representatives of a certain type or class. It is precisely in this context of strong social conventions that Hals' frequently compelling sense of individual character is so remarkable.</P>

<a id="heilbrunnLink3" href="#"><strong>Genre Painting in Northern Europe</strong></a></br>
<div id="heilbrunn3">

<P><P>From a raucous party of smokers at a tavern (32.100.21</a>) to a housewife quietly absorbed in work (32.100.5</a>), from a guardroom of gaming soldiers (64.65.5</a>) to a scene of gallant courtship (32.100.19</a>), the varied subject matter known collectively as genre painting depicted scenes from everyday life, both high and low. Genre painting enjoyed enormous popularity in Northern Europe in this period, particularly in the seventeenth century and especially in the Netherlands, where many of its practitioners elevated what was critically regarded as a humble form to heights of desirability rivaling more classically esteemed subjects</a>, such as history paintings (paintings of biblical scenes, classical history</a>, or mythology</a>).</P></P>
</br>


		<p><P>By the time the French Academy&#151;the Acad&#233;mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture&#151;was founded in 1648, the hierarchy of arts was firmly established and upheld by critics throughout Europe, who ranked paintings according to their subject matter. The artist-writer Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627&#150;1678), for example, in his <em>Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst</em> (Introduction to the elevated school of painting) of 1678, divided paintings into three "grades": still-life painting ranked lowest, as it relied primarily on direct observation and skill, and history painting ranked highest, as it was believed to require imaginative genius for its execution. Occupying the huge middle rung was the form known today as genre painting, but which then lacked a general term (the word <em>genre</em> was probably used in this sense for the first time toward the end of the eighteenth century by French writer Quatrem&#232;re de Quincy). Despite their middling status in contemporary theory, these <em>kleyne beuzelingen</em> (little trifles) were produced in great quantity, often fetched large sums&#151;as did the works of the sought-after <em>fijnschilder</em> (fine painter) Gerrit Dou (1613&#150;1675) (40.64</a>) and his pupil Frans van Mieris (1635&#150;1681)&#151;and were collected by bakers, burghers, and princely patrons alike.<br /><br />The foundations of genre painting in Europe were laid most remarkably by the great Flemish painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder</a> (ca. 1525&#150;1569) (19.164</a>) in the sixteenth century</a>. Bruegel's inhabited landscapes and scenes of peasant life are lively and unsentimental depictions of common occurrence, such as weddings</a> and village fairs. Often pointedly critical of human folly, as in works illustrating ever-popular proverbs and moral sayings, Bruegel's oeuvre had great appeal to collectors</a> and great influence on later artists, who prized his observational powers, humanistic approach, and the "lesson" or witty commentary often contained in his works.<br /><br />In the Netherlands, artists such as Willem Buytewech (1591/92&#150;1624) and Frans Hals</a> (after 1580&#150;1666) were pioneers of the first generation of genre painting. Buytewech, called "Geestige Willem" ("lively" or "witty" Willem), had a short but influential career depicting carousals of the well-heeled (and often badly behaved) as well as peasant life. His drawing <em>Poultry Market in a Dutch Town</em> (2002.122) is a vivid yet dignified portrayal of an everyday activity. Hals, a successful portraitist</a> and painter of military companies, also excelled at genre subjects such as <em>Merrymakers at Shrovetide</em> (14.40.605</a>) and <em>Young Man and Woman in an Inn ("Yonker Ramp and His Sweetheart")</em> (14.40.602</a>). The former, populated by stock characters from comic theater, contains in the characters' gestures and the array of "props" and foodstuffs</a> many thinly veiled sexual references that would have been understood by the viewer (who would have had, besides a certain assumed worldliness, access to the many books of emblems and symbolic devices popular during this time). The latter is an entirely secular treatment of the theme of youthful folly, depicted with especial variety by artists in Hals' native city of Haarlem, and eschews direct reference to its biblical prototype, the tale of the Prodigal Son. Hals' Flemish pupil, Adriaen Brouwer (1606?&#150;1638), specialized in low-life tavern scenes of card players and drunken brawls. In <em>The Smokers</em> (32.100.21</a>), he depicted himself (as the foreground figure blowing smoke rings) and his friends, painters Jan Cossiers and Jan Davidsz. de Heem, with good-natured humor.<br /><br />Through its Golden Age in the seventeenth century, genre painting in the Low Countries remained richly diverse in both style and subject as artists achieved new heights of technical refinement, optical and perspectival sophistication, and an often superb evocation of mood. In Leiden, Gerard Dou established in the early 1630s a reputation as the first and greatest of a school of "fine painters," producing small-format works of high finish and minute detail. These often depicted night scenes illuminated by glowing hearth or candlelight. Gerard ter Borch, the Younger (1617&#150;1681), a native of Zwolle who later settled in Deventer, produced jewel-like paintings of upper-class domestic interiors, where sumptuously attired figures engage in pensive activities such as letter-writing, reading, and gazing into a mirror (49.7.38</a>; 17.190.10</a>). Indeed, a large facet of a genre scene's appeal was the opportunity it afforded to gaze into a private interior</a> much like the one in which it might have hung and, in many cases, to identify with the values expressed by the subject. Paintings by Delft masters Pieter de Hooch (1629-1684) and the less prolific but profoundly accomplished Johannes Vermeer</a> (1632&#150;1675) exhibit compositional clarity, balance, and order, with painstakingly naturalistic lighting effects. They evoke a private world of quiet stillness, from a dozing maid (possibly intoxicated, as indicated by the wineglass</a> nearby) (14.40.611</a>) or a young woman gazing out of a window, pitcher (a traditional symbol of purity) in hand, to an intimate scene of family life (14.40.613</a>). At another extreme, Jan Steen (1626&#150;1679), a native of Haarlem who traveled widely throughout the Netherlands and gathered influences from many sources, specialized in such themes as the chaotic upper-class household overrun by vice, and the lovesick maiden receiving a house-call from a medical quack (46.13.2</a>). Such themes had obviously moralizing overtones, but the result was just as often hilarious in effect. In <em>The Dissolute Household</em> (1982.60.31</a>), a lascivious interaction plays out between man (bearing the features of Steen himself) and serving maid, while the mistress of the house, absorbed in the refilling of her wineglass, remains oblivious. Still-life elements</a> such as the joint of meat cast on the floor and the broken jug warn against profligate behavior, while the clapper and crutch&#151;symbols of poverty and disease&#151;hint at what lies ahead for this wanton family. The contemporary viewer would appreciate the implied moral lesson as well as the wit and imagination of the artist and the degree of descriptive skill entailed.<br /><br />Outside the Netherlands, a group of Dutch and Flemish artists were active by about 1625 in Rome</a>, where they were called the Bamboccianti, after their leader Pieter van Laer (1599&#150;?1642), known as "Il Bamboccio," meaning "puppet" or "ugly doll," because of a physical deformity. The Bamboccianti, including Jan Miel (1599&#150;1664) (93.29), Johannes Lingelbach (1622&#150;1674) (71.123</a>), and Michiel Sweerts (1618&#150;1664), painted scenes of contemporary life in the Roman countryside, strongly influenced in their subject matter, realistic description of detail, and dramatic lighting effects by the Italian painter Caravaggio</a> (1571&#150;1610). Around the same time, Louis Le Nain (1593?&#150;1648), active in Paris, achieved a classicizing gravitas in genre scenes such as the <em>Peasant Family</em> (Mus&#233;e du Louvre, Paris). His work inspired the street scenes of Jean Michelin (ca. 1616&#150;1670) (27.59</a>), a French painter of the next generation. These artists, working outside of the Dutch tradition, were interested in an unidealized depiction of everyday reality without moralizing social commentary.<br /><br />By the eighteenth century, the popularity of genre painting in the Netherlands was eclipsed somewhat by a taste for larger-scale decorative works</a>. Genre themes, often inspired by earlier Dutch works (20.155.8</a>), remained popular in the oeuvres of French artists Jean Sim&#233;on Chardin (1699&#150;1779), Jean Baptiste Greuze (1725&#150;1805), and Jean Honor&#233; Fragonard</a> (1732&#150;1806). Chardin favored subjects of children at play, reflective studies of quiet absorption, as in <em>Soap Bubbles</em> (49.24</a>) (where the bubble may allude to the transience of life). In works such as <em>The Stolen Kiss</em> (56.100.1</a>), Fragonard allows the viewer a titillatingly voyeuristic glimpse of a moment of passionate abandon.</P>

<div id="heilbrunn4">
<strong>Overview</strong></br>
<P>The seventeenth century is rightly referred to as a Golden Age of Dutch art, as the United Provinces establishes its independence, declared in 1581 and recognized officially in 1648, from Spanish Habsburg rule. Schools of painting arise in cities such as Amsterdam, Delft, Haarlem, Utrecht, and Dordrecht, where a variety of genres are developed and the production of decorative arts flourishes. Civic bodies and wealthy lay citizens, including merchants who make their fortunes in Holland's vast overseas trade empire</a>, are key patrons. Meanwhile, the Southern Netherlands remains under Catholic Habsburg rule, and church commissions proliferate. The port city of Antwerp is a major cultural and commercial center and home to the two greatest Flemish masters of the age: Peter Paul Rubens (1577&#150;1640) and Anthony van Dyck (1599&#150;1641)</a>. The widely traveled Rubens, whose professional life extends beyond visual artistry to political diplomacy, plays a vital role in the spread of Baroque ideals</a> from their fountainhead in Rome to the North.</P>

<P>During the eighteenth century, the Low Countries, exhausted by intermittent wars of the previous century for political independence and trading rights, slips from cultural prominence and wealth. Rival countries England and France meanwhile rise to great political power and economic strength, and are the seat of major intellectual developments that give rise to the Enlightenment and the Neoclassical movement in the arts and architecture. Shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792, the region falls under French occupation. The arts of this time are marked by the influence of French styles: the ornate Rococo and, later, Neoclassicism</a>.</P>

<strong>Key Events</strong></br>

				<ul>
<strong><P>&#149; by 1600</strong> The glassmaking industry is well established in the Low Countries, and thrives throughout the century, with centers at Antwerp, Li&egrave;ge, Amsterdam, and Middelburg. Drinking vessels such as <I>berkemeyers</I>&#151;glasses with a thick stem and wide funnel-shaped bowl&#151;and <I>roemers</I>&#151;glasses with a hollow stem studded with protruding knob-shaped decorations known as <I>prunts</I>&#151;are widely popular; the most elaborate of these are ornamented with gilt or diamond-point engraving of exquisite detail. Anna Roemers Visscher (1583&#150;1651), a member of the poet Pieter Cornelisz. Hooft's literary circle called the Muiderkring, is one of the finest glass calligraphers of the period: her vessels are inscribed with poetic text, often in several languages, and bear delicately rendered botanicals, insects, and other decorative motifs.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; by early 17th century</strong> Still-life painting</a> flourishes in the Low Countries as an independent genre. Widely popular are <I>vanitas</I> compositions, in which objects such as skulls, bubbles, and timepieces allude to fleeting time and the ephemeral nature of worldly luxuries. Other still lifes seem to celebrate in opulent detail the very same luxuries: floral pictures painted by Balthasar van der Ast, Jan Bruegel the Elder and Younger, and many others combine in a single arrangement coveted and costly blossoms from many countries, while the "banquet" and "breakfast" still lifes of artists such as Pieter Claesz and Willem Claesz Heda allow, in their arrangement of foods, utensils, and drinking vessels, for a display of the painter's ability to render surface detail and texture with astonishing realism.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1603</strong> Hendrick de Keyser (1565&#150;1621) is appointed architect to the city of Amsterdam, where he raises churches, towers, official buildings, and secular structures such as the Zuiderkerk (1603), Westerkerk (1620), and the residence De Dolfijn (1605). The classical vocabulary</a> with which he articulates his architectural designs is carried with even greater emphasis into his sculptural works. In 1608, he produces one of the first marble portrait busts to be made in the Netherlands. Recalling antique Roman portrait sculpture</A> in its pensive dignity and voluminous drapery enrobing the figure, it elevates its burgher subject, Vincent Coster (1553&#150;1608/10), to a classical majesty.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1605</strong> <I>The Golden Age</I> (1993.333</a>), painted in this year by Utrecht artist Joachim Wtewael (1566&#150;1638), exemplifies the Northern Mannerist style</A>&#151;of which Wtewael is a late exponent&#151;in its jewel-like coloring and contorted figures.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; early 17th century</strong> Haarlem is one of the most important cities in the Low Countries, a commercial and cultural center, home to a lively printmaking</a> industry as well as a large community of artists, many of them Flemish settlers who bring the artistic traditions of the Southern Netherlands north to Holland. It is here that landscape painting undergoes a significant development, evolving from the fantastic compositions of the sixteenth century&#151;in which the landscape, though often prominent, usually serves as the setting for a biblical or mythological narrative&#151;to a more naturalistic depiction of nature, in which the landscape itself is more often the subject. Landscape artists active in Haarlem include Salomon van Ruysdael (1600/1603&#150;1670)&#151;who produces tonal pieces in keeping with a style tending toward monochrome that proliferates in the 1620s&#150;50s&#151;and his more famous nephew, Jacob van Ruisdael (1628/29&#150;1682), who brings ambitious composition and an often monumental quality to his canvases, as seen in <I>Wheat Fields</I> (14.40.623). Landscape production thrives in other centers as well. Aelbert Cuyp (1620&#150;1691), active in Dordrecht and producing his mature works at mid-century, is one of the greatest painters in this genre, infusing his landscapes, townscapes, equestrian portraits, cattle pieces, and other compositions with a majesty in part effected by lighting techniques influenced by the Italian Baroque.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1608</strong> Peter Paul Rubens (1577&#150;1640) returns to his native Antwerp after travels in Spain and Italy, where he absorbs the profound influence of classical and Renaissance masterpieces and secures the patronage of the clergy and ruling houses of Mantua, Genoa, and Rome. From this year he serves as official painter to archdukes Albert and Isabella in Brussels, but continues to dwell in Antwerp as one of its most influential citizens. Around this time he produces several of his greatest monumental religious works, including <I>The Raising of the Cross</I> (1610&#150;11; now Antwerp Cathedral) and <I>The Descent from the Cross</I> (1612&#150;14; Antwerp Cathedral). Rubens's urbanity and imagination, matchless versatility and prolific output, personal vitality and, above all, a vitality of technique make him the greatest Flemish artist of the period and one of the most important European artists of the age. Through his deep knowledge of Italian painting, combined with extensive travels as a political emissary, he is a major contributor to the dissemination of Italian Baroque style in the North.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1610</strong> Peter Paul Rubens purchases a sixteenth-century building in Antwerp for use as a residence and studio and, over the next decade, remodels it to his own design. To the existing structure he adds a wing in the style of Italian palazzi, and chooses a decorative program based on classical themes (known and largely reconstructed from prints of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries). The splendid portico in particular, with its Stoic inscriptions and crowning sculptures of Hermes and Athena&#151;who together represent the union of trade and the arts&#151;expresses Rubens's humanist ideology. In a city dominated by Gothic structures</a>, the Rubens House is an outstanding monument of the Baroque and a testament to the artist's erudition as well as his gift for uniting past and present.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1614</strong> Thirty years after the assassination of William the Silent (1533&#150;1584), founder of the Dutch state, Hendrick de Keyser receives the ambitious commission that results in his sculptural masterwork: a tomb for the prince at his heretofore unassuming resting place in the Nieuwe Kerk, Delft. The splendid monument of black and white marble, dinant stone, and bronze bears two lifesize images of the prince: one rests in state under an architectural canopy, presided over by the winged figure of Fame, while the other, at the front of the monument, sits, scepter in hand, as in life. Female figures representing Liberty, Faith, Fortitude, and Justice stand in niches topped by obelisks. The tomb&#151;remarkable in the deft adoption of a classical vocabulary and expressive handling of garment drapery that are the hallmarks of de Keyser's style&#151;is completed in 1621, the year of the master's death.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1620</strong> British nobleman Thomas Howard, second earl of Arundel, discovers Anthony van Dyck</a> (1599&#150;1641), a precociously gifted young painter, at work in the studio of Peter Paul Rubens in Antwerp, and shortly thereafter brings him to London. Van Dyck's stay, though brief, wins him great acclaim among the English nobility. The artist then travels to Italy and France before returning in 1627 to Antwerp, where he works until late 1631. He settles permanently in England in the following year, with a short return to Flanders in 1634&#150;35. Religious works&#151;such as the early altarpiece <I>Saint Augustine in Ecstasy</I> (1628) for the Church of Saint Augustine in Antwerp&#151;are well represented in van Dyck's oeuvre; however, it is as a portraitist</a> of consummate skill, sensitivity, and unrivaled refinement that he is chiefly famed. Also a gifted etcher</a>, he compiles a series of prints</a>, called the <I>Iconography</I>, depicting his most illustrious contemporaries.</li>

<strong><P>&#149; 1620s</strong> In Utrecht, a group of painters led by Hendrick ter Brugghen (1588&#150;1629), Dirck van Baburen (1590/95&#150;1624), and Gerrit van Honthorst (1592&#150;1656) work in a style influenced by Caravaggio</a> (1571&#150;1610), whose paintings they encounter during travel and study in Rome</a>. Known as the Utrecht Caravaggisti, these painters produce works that reflect the innovations of the Roman master in their use of strong contrasts of light and dark, genre and history themes, and compositions of few figures in a cropped or half-length format.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1630s</strong> Painter Frans Hals</a> (1582/83&#150;1666) is at the height of his success as a portraitist, executing single and double portraits as well as large canvases of civic guard companies. Hals's works of these years and earlier employ a vivid palette and loose brushwork to suggest the play of bright light on surfaces; later works are even looser in execution, while the palette becomes more sober. In his paintings, the artist deemphasizes setting and focuses instead on the figure, giving even the characters of a nonspecific genre scene a portraitlike quality (see <I>Young Man and Woman in an Inn</I>, 14.40.602).</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1631</strong> Rembrandt van Rijn</a> (1606&#150;1669) leaves his native Leiden and settles, for the remainder of his life, in Amsterdam. Already prolific as a painter, draftsman, and etcher of many subjects, Rembrandt secures his fame in Amsterdam with the dramatic appeal of his portraits and <I>tronies</I>, bust-length figural compositions&#151;usually incorporating elaborate or exotic costume&#151;drawn or painted from life but not intended as portraits. Rembrandt's greatest aspiration&#151;the depiction of historical scenes&#151;bears abundant fruit in compositions that fuse his gift for narrative with a virtuosic sensitivity as a portraitist. Foremost among these are the group portraits of <I>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp</I> (1632, Mauritshuis, The Hague) and the so-called <I>Night Watch</I> (1642, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), painted at the peak of the artist's fame. From this point onward, Rembrandt's works are increasingly pensive and painterly in their execution. The artist's preoccupation with life drawing may be seen in the many studies and self-portraits he executes throughout his career. In addition to portraits and histories, Rembrandt produces genre scenes and landscapes; his rounded mastery of several media, combined with extraordinary descriptive ability, make him the greatest Dutch artist of his century, a title acknowledged in his own lifetime in the Low Countries and beyond.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1631</strong> After three years of study with Rembrandt, Gerrit Dou (1613&#150;1675) establishes his reputation as a master skilled in small-format pictures of high finish and minute detail. He is the earliest and most influential of a group of Leiden artists known as "fine painters," or <I>fijnschilders</I>, whose works bear similar characteristics. Dou develops (1640s) the niche format often used by the <I>fijnschilders</I> to achieve a sense of spatial depth and other illusionistic effects: a window or arch frames the figural subject or interior scene and provides a ledge for the arrangement of still-life objects. He also explores the evocative potential of artificial illumination in night scenes lit by candle, lantern, or hearth. Although Dou and his pupils Frans van Mieris the Elder (1635&#150;1681) and Pieter Cornelisz. van Slingeland (1640&#150;1691) are the finest practitioners of the genre, several generations of <I>fijnschilders</I> thrive in Leiden through the first half of the eighteenth century.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; ca. 1635</strong> Judith Leyster (1609&#150;1660), one of the few influential Dutch female painters of this period, executes <I>The Young Flute Player</I> (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm). This masterful work, in its half-length format, simplicity of composition, tonality, and illumination, is well informed by the Utrecht Caravaggisti as well as by other masters&#151;particularly Frans Hals</a>&#151;active in Haarlem, the center of Leyster's activity.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; ca. 1636</strong> Active in Antwerp, Adriaen Brouwer (1606?&#150;1638) paints <I>The Smokers</I> (32.100.21), a panel in which the artist wittily portrays himself, the artist Jan Davidsz de Heem, and another companion partaking of one of the most popular pastimes of the period. The panel illustrates two of Brouwer's most important contributions to genre painting in the Low Countries: the introduction of an interior setting to peasant or "low-life" scenes&#151;in which drinking parties, card games, and brawls are carried out, often with a moralizing intent that nonetheless has a humorous aspect&#151;and the exploration of facial expression as a graphic means of conveying extremes of emotion, from the inebriated merriment of revelers in a tavern to the pain of a patient under the surgeon's knife.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1646</strong> Pieter Post (1608&#150;1669), court architect to the Dutch stadholder Frederick Henry, designs a residence in the Hague for Frederick's wife, the princess Amalia von Solms. Called the Huis ten Bosch, the house embodies an architectural style known as Dutch classicism. This movement is inspired by Italian models, with particular attention to Andrea Palladio's</a> theories of proportion, balance, and symmetry. By the end of the century, Dutch classicism reaches such a height of severity that it is called the Austere style: ornament is reduced to a bare minimum in favor of simplified monumentality.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1647</strong> At the cessation of Chinese porcelain export to Europe</a>, local potteries experience a surge of expansion and success. Chief among these are the workshops in Delft; the blue and white tin-glazed earthenware plaques, dishes, and ornamental objects produced in this city often emulate Chinese models in design and ornamental motif, or serve a commemorative function, depicting actual interiors, notable persons, or monuments.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1648</strong> The Dutch Republic is recognized as an independent state at the Peace of Westphalia, the treaty that ends the Thirty Years' War (1618&#150;48). In this year, work is begun on the Stadhuis, or town hall (now Royal Palace), to the design of Jacob van Campen (1595&#150;1657), a major proponent of Dutch classicism. City architect Dani&euml;l Stalpaert (1615&#150;1676) sees the building project through to completion in 1665. Sculptural decoration is executed by the Quellinus family of Antwerp.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1650</strong> Gerrit Houckgeest (ca. 1600&#150;1661) paints the <I>Interior of the Nieuwe Kerk, Delft, with the Tomb of William the Silent</I> (Kunsthalle, Hamburg), his masterpiece and, beyond his own oeuvre, one of the greatest examples of architectural painting. The panel is unprecedented and later unmatched in its spatial fidelity to the subject&#151;achieved by an oblique system of perspective&#151;as well as in its exacting description of interior details. The practice of architectural painting is pioneered in the sensitively handled, light-filled church interiors of Haarlem artist Pieter Saenredam (1597&#150;1665). Other masters of this genre include Hendrick Cornelisz. van Vliet (1611/12&#150;1675) and Emanuel de Witte (ca. 1617&#150;1691/92), a late and exceptionally gifted exponent (see <I>Interior of the Old Church in Delft</I>, 2001.403).</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1650s&#150;60s</strong> Still-life paintings</a> produced in Amsterdam reflect the city's status as a financial center and cultural hub. Artists including Willem Kalf (1619&#150;1693) depict objects&#151;many imported luxury goods&#151;of a degree of splendor unseen in earlier still lifes. Around this time, game pieces featuring dead fowl, rabbits, and other hunting trophies, as well as still lifes with live animals rise in popularity, and allude to the comforts of an aristocratic country life. Notable among the painters of game are Frans Snyders (1579&#150;1657) and Jan Fyt (1611&#150;1661).</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1655</strong> Johannes Vermeer</a> (1632&#150;1675) registers as an independent master in the Delft guild. While most of Vermeer's early pictures stylistically survey the works of other prominent artists of the period, his mature canvases of domestic interiors, usually inhabited by one or two figures, are characterized by compositional clarity, balance, a studied perspective, and painstakingly achieved naturalistic lighting effects. They are moreover imbued with a sense of stillness, reflective quiet, and even isolation. His works relate in many aspects&#151;subject matter, perspectival concerns, and quality of light&#151;to those of Pieter de Hooch (1629&#150;1684), a close contemporary active until about 1661 in Delft.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1661&#150;70</strong> Jan Steen (1626&#150;1679) lives in Haarlem, where he produces masterworks of genre painting</a>. Steen's travels expose him to the prevalent styles and resident masters of various Dutch cities: the meticulously observed and highly finished works of painters from his native Leiden, particularly Frans van Mieris (1635&#150;1681); the spatial and optical innovations of painters active in Delft; and the tradition of "low-life" genre painting practiced in Haarlem and exemplified by the oeuvre of Adriaen van Ostade (1610&#150;1684), possibly Steen's teacher. In his finest works, Steen brings to genre painting a vibrancy that results partly from the relationships he establishes between the figures depicted through expression and gesture&#151;often sly and laden with innuendo&#151;and partly through profuse detail, including objects that may allude to the subject matter, in either their placement or their traditional association. Steen's canvases often illustrate moralizing proverbs and depict the dissolution&#151;especially in the form of a chaotic household&#151;that occurs with gluttony, sloth, or intemperate passions. During his years in Haarlem, he also produces the best of his medical scenes, which usually feature a perplexed doctor who pays a housecall to a young woman suffering not from physical illness but lovesickness.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; late 17th&#150;early 18th century</strong> Brussels, the center of tapestry making</a> in the Netherlands, witnesses its greatest flourishing of production in roughly a century. The grand and theatrical designs provided from about 1610 through the first half of the century by master painters of the Baroque, such as Peter Paul Rubens and Jacob Jordaens (1593&#150;1678), give way during these years to a more refined decorative style influenced by the developing French Rococo.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; ca. 1688</strong> The Li&egrave;ge artist Gerard de Lairesse (1641&#150;1711) paints a monumental series of seven canvases allegorizing princely virtue for the Council Room of the Binnenhof in the Hague. At work in Amsterdam since about 1665, Lairesse establishes a clientele of wealthy elite and the intellectual bourgeoisie who favor his elegant, classicizing compositions, reflective of contemporary French tastes and making a strong departure from the naturalism that has prevailed in Dutch art up to this point.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1737</strong> Jacob de Wit (1695&#150;1754), the foremost Dutch decorative painter of the eighteenth century, completes <I>Moses Choosing the Seventy Elders</I>, one of his masterworks, for the Amsterdam Stadhuis. De Wit works in a florid Rococo style and is well known for his grisailles in imitation of sculptural relief.</li>
<strong><P>&#149; 1765</strong> The Amsterdam Academy of Drawing is founded, where Jacob Otten-Husly (1738&#150;1796) serves as director. The Academy disseminates the theories of Neoclassicism</a>, informed in great part by contact with France</a>. Otten-Husly's design for the Felix Meritis building (1787), with its colossal Corinthian columns, arched windows, and crowning pediment, attests to the master's understanding of this idiom.</li>

<strong><P>&#149; 1784</strong> Abraham van der Hart (1747&#150;1820), city architect of Amsterdam since 1777, designs the Maagdenhuis, a Catholic home for young women. It embodies a strict Neoclassical style</a> that pervades Dutch architecture in the second half of the eighteenth century.</li>
