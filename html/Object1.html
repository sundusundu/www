    <p>Cornelis van Spaendonck was born in the Dutch city of
    Tilburg, but by the age of seventeen he had followed his
    older brother Gerardus, also a gifted still life artist, to
    Paris, where they both enjoyed long and successful careers.
    Cornelis, for example, was director of the great Sèvres
    porcelain works.</p>
    <p>Although Spaendonck’s work is removed in time by more than
    a century from the height of flower painting initiated by
    painters like Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder and Roelant
    Saverij during the so-called golden age, it shares with
    the work of these early artists a great technical
    virtuosity, finish, and sensitivity to lighting in its
    depiction of a lush cornucopia of flowers that spill over
    the canvas. Given the later date of Spaendonck’s work, it
    is generally agreed among scholars that less meaning
    should be read into the presence and placement of
    individual flowers, and felt that viewers should merely
    experience the enjoyment of nature’s generosity and the
    artist’s skill. Still, it does not seem possible to
    entirely discount the symbolism of sleep, death, and
    rebirth in the respective presentation of poppies, lilacs,
    and morning glories here; along with these, the
    mindfulness urged by the forget-me-nots at the very center
    of the composition may assert a commemorative function for
    this picture. Or, perhaps Spaendonck intended a clever to
    the tale of the goddess Demeter from classical mythology
    (whose flower is the poppy) whose loss of her daughter
    Persephone to Hades, lord of the underworld, for half of
    each year, was the ancient explanation for the cyclical
    death and renewal of the natural world in the four
    seasons.</p>
